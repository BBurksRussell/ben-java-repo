=============

This is where I keep my java code. Much of this code is from projects assigned to me as a student at Uplift. 
I first began pushing my code here as a way to show potential employers the things I had learned. 
During my volunteer work with <a href="www.upliftdc.org">Uplift, Inc.</a> I thought it would be fun
to develop a baseball simulator. I began designing the course for the Spring/Summer 2013 sessions at Uplift, but of 
the students who signed up, none wanted to build a baseball simulator. The code that I wrote for that course is fully
commented and available in the AtBat.java file.
